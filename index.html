                If Trevor appears in Grand Theft Auto 6, Steven Ogg thinks it would be "fun" for the character to be killed off at the beginning of the game. Assuming it meets its planned release window and isn't delayed to next year, Grand Theft Auto 6 will be launching a whopping 12 years after GTA 5 first hit store shelves in 2013.

                <p>
                    Nvidia's Arm-based consumer PC platform, which has reportedly been in development for a while, is set to launch about a year from now, in September 2025, according to DigiTimes. The Arm-based PC platform for Windows is expected to rely on Nvidia's own CPU and GPU designs and will likely target the premium segment of the market.

                    Marvel Rivals kicked off the Spring Festival event, adding a new game mode called Clash of Dancing Lions, challenges, and limited time cosmetics. Similarly to the Winter Celebration event, players can earn a new currency called Danqing, a "magical dye" that is used to decorate a painting on the event page and unlock new rewards. For those who want a little more from the event, Marvel Rivals has premium cosmetics for sale, including the Lion's Gaze costume for Iron Fist.

                    Nvidia's RTX 5090 is soon to be released
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The release date for Nvidia's top-tier halo GPU is almost upon us. The Nvidia RTX 5090 is coming, and you can attempt to buy one when the card launches on January 30th, 2025. I say this because we expect demand for this new beast of a GPU to be extremely high, even with its incredibly high price tag. <br><br>
                    From rumors and reports we've heard, stock levels for the 5090 look to be quite low, so if you're really interested in getting your hands on one, you had better be prepared to camp out on retailer websites and be hovering over that buy button as the cards go on sale as stock will likely evaporate in seconds.
